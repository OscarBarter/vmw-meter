This describes how to build the pi-ps2-gpio board included here.

See the PARTS file for a list of parts.

Included under the pi-ps2-hat directory is the GEDA/gerber files for
making the board.  You can also purchase one (well, three) from OSHPark

1. Put the 26-pin hat header through the holes and solder in place.
	The pins should poke through the top side of the board
	(the side that doesn't say VMW on it).
	This is actually a pain to do.

	Alternately, if you don't want to use this with a pi, you
	can just use a regular SIP header and connect to the board
	with jumper wires.  Only 5 connectors are important.
	5V, 3.3V, GND, and two GPIOs (pins 1,2,6,16, and 18).

2. Solder in place the two 4.7k resistors.  I did this on the top
	of the board but you can do it on the bottom too.

3. Solder in place the two-pin SIP headers.  I did this so that you
	could pop the jumper blocks off and disconnect the GPIOs
	w/o removing the board.  You can also in that case jumper
	to alternate GPIO pins if you wanted to use ones other
	than GPIO23/24

4. Put together the Level Shifter and then solder in place on top.
	The top of the Level Shifter board (with HV and LV) corresponds 
	to the triangle on the solder-mask.

5. Solder the DIN6 PS/2 connector to the top of the board.

6. Solder the USBA connector to the top of the board.

	Note: You don't need to connect both PS/2 and USB connectors.
		If you are only going to use one you can leave the
		other off.

7. Use jumper blocks on the SIP header to connect up the GPIOs.

8. Install on your pi (be sure the USB/PS2 connectors are facing out,
	and that you line up the header to be at the very top of the
	GPIO header.  This is easier to get wrong on B+/A+ boards
	that have more pins).

	You probably want to do the above with the power off.
	Hook up the keyboard too.

9. Try out one of the testing tools, or install the Linux kernel module
	provided.
