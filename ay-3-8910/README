****** Raspberry Pi AY-3-8910 YM chiptune player ******

	by Vince Weaver (vince@deater.net)

Hardware:
	Should update this with more complete info.

	Parts are:
		AY-3-8910 (bought off e-bay)
		74HC595 shift register (to reduce GPIO count as 
			well as act as 3.3V to 5V converter)
		Adafruit level converter (for the I/O lines)
		1MHz oscillator (anything from 1-2MHz probably works
			but you get overflows on some sound files
			if you use 2MHz)
		LM386 and various discrete components.
			Reference design is based on Figure 16 in
			the AY-3-8910 manual.
			Have replaced with adafruit MAX98306 class-D
			streo amplifier in my setup.
		ht16k33 i2c breakout board, adafruit (i2c addr 0x70)
			To run the three bargraphs.
			Bargraphs were GYR models from Jameco/SEED
		ht16k33 i2c 16x8 backpack, adafruit (i2c addr 0x72)
		8 Ohm speaker

	Pi Connections:
		Pi to 74HC595:
			DS (serial in)		GPIO17
			SHCP (serial clock)	GPIO27
			STCP (output clock)	GPIO22
		Pi to AY-3-8910 (through level converter)
			BC1			GPIO18
			BDIR			GPIO23
			|RESET			GPIO24


Installing:

	+ Install the bcm2835 library

		The raw Linux GPIO interface just isn't fast enough.

		wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
		uncompress/cd into directory
		./configure
		make
		make install

	+ Install the liblhasa-dev library

		This lets you play LHA compressed ym5 files
		which is pretty much any you find.

		apt-get install liblhasa-dev

		If you compile liblhasa from scratch (or are not on Debian)
		you might need to change the settings at the top of the
		Makefile.

		Alternately you could not use liblhasa at all and manually
		use the "lhasa" utility to decompress files before playing them.
		lhasa -e INTRO2.ym

	+ Then just run "make" in this dir to create "ym_play"

	+ There are various command line arguments.
		See "ym_play -h"

Playing music:
	./ym_play YM_FILE

Keybindings:
	' ' (space)	pause/play
	,		rewind song to beginning
	.		fastforward 5s
	<		skip to previous song
	>		skip to next song
	l		toggle looping of current song
	r		toggle repeating playlist when done
	m		switch 8x16 display mode


More info on the YM file format:

	YM file format
		http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/ymformat.html

	To play ymfiles on Linux:
		apt-get install stymulator
		ymplayer YM_FILE

	To convert PT2 or AY files to YM:
		Install the Linux Ayemul player
		Load the file
		Click on "pl" then right click on the file to save as.

	I have not included any YM files here because most of the ones you
	find are ripped from old Atari/Spectrum games so the copyright
	situation is a bit complex.

TODO:
	* Make up some PCBs
	* Put it in a case/enclosure
	* Use SPI to drive the shift register instead of GPIO
	* Optimize the software.
		Even using libbcm2835 it's hard to hit 50Hz from inside Linux
		(maybe use my custom low-level OS instead).
		The overhead wouldn't be so bad if I was using a parallel
		load of the registers, but that would have taken 11 GPIOs
		(with 3.3V to 5V level conversion).
		I do need to make a bare metal design, because it's sad to
		have the Pi shown better by an old 6502 Apple II running at
		1MHz (see the French Touch "Pure Noise" Demo)
	* Find a tracker and start writing my own YM files.
