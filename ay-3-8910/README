****** Raspberry Pi AY-3-8910 YM chiptune player ******

	by Vince Weaver (vince@deater.net)

Hardware:

	See the full details and build instructions in
	./hardware/build_instructions

	As a summary, it's two AY-3-8910 chips, with 3 channels each.
	One is for right, one for left.

	The pi talks to the AY-3-8910 via SPI and GPIOs.

	In addition there is a MAX 98306 amplifier, which the Pi
	controls the volume of using GPIO.

	Also a headphone jack with an auto-sense circuit.

	Pi Connections:
		Pi to 74HC595 (through level converter)
			DS (serial in)		MOSI
			SHCP (serial clock)	CLK
			STCP (output clock)	CE0
		Pi to AY-3-8910 (through level converter)
			BC1			GPIO18
			BDIR			GPIO23
			|RESET			GPIO24


Software Installing:

	+ Install the bcm2835 library

		The raw Linux GPIO interface just isn't fast enough.

		wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
		uncompress/cd into directory
		./configure
		make
		make install

	+ Install the liblhasa-dev library

		This lets you play LHA compressed ym5 files
		which is pretty much any you find.

		apt-get install liblhasa-dev

		If you compile liblhasa from scratch (or are not on Debian)
		you might need to change the settings at the top of the
		Makefile.

		Alternately you could not use liblhasa at all and manually
		use the "lhasa" utility to decompress files before playing them.
		lhasa -e INTRO2.ym

	+ Then just run "make" in this dir to create "ym_play"

	+ There are various command line arguments.
		See "ym_play -h"

Playing music:
	./ym_play YM_FILE

Keybindings:
	' ' (space)	pause/play
	,		rewind song to beginning
	.		fastforward 5s
	<		skip to previous song
	>		skip to next song
	l		toggle looping of current song
	r		toggle repeating playlist when done
	m		switch 8x16 display mode
	+		volume up
	-		volume down
	a/b/c/n		toggle channel

More info on the YM file format:

	YM file format
		http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/ymformat.html

	To play ymfiles on Linux:
		apt-get install stymulator
		ymplayer YM_FILE

	To convert PT2 or AY files to YM:
		Install the Linux Ayemul player
		Load the file
		Click on "pl" then right click on the file to save as.

	I have not included any YM files here because most of the ones you
	find are ripped from old Atari/Spectrum games so the copyright
	situation is a bit complex.

TODO:
	* Make up some PCBs
	* Put it in a case/enclosure
	* Find a tracker and start writing my own YM files. 

Performance:
	In general, to play 50Hz sound files (typical) need to update
	the AY-3-8910 every 20ms.

	We need libbcm2835 for this, as the Linux sysfs GPIO interface
	is nowhere near fast enough.

	We use a serial->parallel shift register to avoid using too many
	GPIOs (and a similar number of 3.3V to 5V level converters)

	Initially had problems with SPI so was bitbanging everything:

		ym_play_frame:				 14ms
		display_update (bars+waterfall):	1-3ms
		display_read_keypad:			  0.5ms
		display_string (14seg):			  5ms
							=======
							 23ms

	You can see that was too much delay and we couldn't hit 50Hz.

	I did finally get SPI working and now it is much better:

		ym_play_frame:				  8ms
		display_update (bars+waterfall):	1-3ms
		display_read_keypad:			  0.5ms
		display_string (14seg):			  5ms
							========
							 17ms

	Probably could get much better performance if running w/o
	Linux on my own OS, but this is probably good enough for now.

	Funny it's so hard to get Linux on a high-end ARM chip to keep
	up, as the 1MHz Apple II can manage with a similar Mockingboard 
	sound card (see the French Touch "Pure Noise" Demo)


Recording from line out:
	This is needlessly tricky on Linux.
	
	One solution I found, when using a USB sound card for input,
	was "audacity"
