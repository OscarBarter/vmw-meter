For MARK1 board:

* Forgot to label buttons
* Forgot to label V/D/G/C on the i2c adapter socket
* The lower holes on the 14seg displays do not line up.
* The #2 drill holes are just barely big enough, could be made a bit wider.
* The top center offset hole isn't wide enough to take a washer/nut without
  shorting the switch contacts.
* The 10-segment bargraph footprint is actually wider than it needs to be.
* The speaker openings could use some work too.
