1. Get the purple PCBs from OSH Park
2. File down the little nubs around the edges, especially in the speaker
	areas
3. Make an i2c cable.  see the pi cluster directions.
	not labeled on Mark1 PCB
	square is VDD, then it's SDA, GND, SCL

3. First solder on the things on the back.  First the 4 pin socket.

4. Next to the ht16k33 breakout.  (Build it first, putting the pin
	headers on each side)  We leave it at default i2c address (0x70)

5.  Now might be a good time to hook things up and test with i2c-scan
	to see if it is detecting properly.

6.  Next the diode and 8 resistors 39korange white orange

7. 20-pin sockets

8 8 switches

9. 14 seg.  left is 101, middle 110 111

	put screws in toprow, screw through buttom, spacer, nut
	on bottom, wrong size, so put going down, screw, spacer
	and nut on other side.
WHICH ONES?


put in 8x16

11. put in bargraph. left words on bottom, right words on top
