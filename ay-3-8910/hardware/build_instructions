1. Get the purple PCBs from OSH Park
2. File down the little nubs around the edges, especially in the speaker
	areas
3. Make an i2c cable.  see the pi cluster directions.
	not labeled on Mark1 PCB
	square is VDD, then it's SDA, GND, SCL

3. First solder on the things on the back.  First the 4 pin socket.

4. Next to the ht16k33 breakout.  (Build it first, putting the pin
	headers on each side)  We leave it at default i2c address (0x70)

5.  Now might be a good time to hook things up and test with i2c-scan
	to see if it is detecting properly.

6.  Next the diode (band direction is indicated)
	and 8 39k  resistors (orange white orange)

7.  Next solder in the 20-pin sockets

8.  Next the 8 switches.  There are bumps on the bottom of the
	switches that slot into holes on the board, which should
	ensure correct orientation.

9. Now it's time for the adafruit 14-segment LED boards.
	First solder the headers onto them.

	Next, assuming you are using #2 screws, we need to enlarge the
	drill holes on the Adafruit boards as they are just slightly too
	small.  I used a file, a drill can maybe be used.

	Solder the three boards to have different i2c addresses.
	Left is 101, middle 110, right 111.

	Now set up the spacers and screws.  This didn't really go according
	to plan (mostly due to nut size and the lower holes being in the
	wrong place on the Mark1 board).

	TODO: diagram

	Each board will be floating a bit in the air to avoid shorting out
	against component leads from the other side.  The height is equal
	to one 1/8" spacer plus a nut length.  

	On the top row, put the screw from the bottom, with a spacer and a nut.
	The board should slip onto this.  There is not enough clearance
	to put an additiona nut on top.
	On the lower ones, put the screw in from *the top* going through 
	a spacer with a nut on the other side.
	The bottom holes on the middle display are too close to the ones
	on either side, so leave those off.

10.	Now put on the Adafruit 8x16 LED display.  Attach the header.
	Expand all four holes on the board.
	The holes all work for this one, so put the screw from the bottom,
	with a spacer and nut on top.

11.	Put the 10-segment bargraph displays into the sockets.
	On the left side of the board the lettering on the displays should
	face down, on the right side they should face up.

12.	Put the five 0.5" standoffs into the board from the bottom, with
	a washer and nut on top.  The top center nut won't fit w/o shorting
	the switch, so leave it out for now.

13.	Put button tops onto the buttons (colors are up to you)

14.	Plug in the i2c wire and test (if you haven't been testing all along)
