Many of these made myself, or based on the geda provided ones.


Turning a bitmap image into a footprint is a pain.

Load into inkscape, path trace->bitmap

Get it traced, then save as ps

pstoedit -f pcb tf7_vince.ps -ssp tf7_vince.fp

But this is made of polygons, and you can't put polygons into a footprint
(it only wants lines and vias).

One thing you can do is load into pcb and then trace over it with the
line tool, which is what I did in the end.
