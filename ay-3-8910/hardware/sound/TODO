Fix the pin order on the MAX breakout
Make sure the bypass caps are bypassing

Label the resistors with values
Label the caps with values
Label the i2c connector
Label the audio connector

Long Range:
Flip the tri-states so wires don't cross?

Done:
+ Flip the shifters so the one closest to the pi gets MOSI
+ Ground Plane fill
+ Hole Clearances
+ Pullup on the shutdown line so no noise on reboot
	(but haven't rebooted yet)
+ Test RTC (need battery)
+ Test the headphone switch (seems to work)
