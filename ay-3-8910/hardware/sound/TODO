Long Range:
Flip the tri-states so wires don't cross?

Done:
+ Flip the shifters so the one closest to the pi gets MOSI
+ Ground Plane fill
+ Hole Clearances
+ Pullup on the shutdown line so no noise on reboot
	(but haven't rebooted yet)
+ Test RTC (need battery)
+ Test the headphone switch (seems to work)
+ Fix the pin order on the MAX breakout
+ Make sure the bypass caps are bypassing
  (the ones on the shifters aren't as close to Vdd as they could be)
+ Label the resistors with values
+ Label the caps with values
+ Label the i2c connector
+ Label the audio connector
