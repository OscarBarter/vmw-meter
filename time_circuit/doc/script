Sometime in 2014

V in glasses, hat?

+ At last my time circuitry is complete!
  Where shoud I go?

  Maybe a baseball game.  I'm tired of waiting on the Os to do
  something useful.  Let's go see the 1983 World Series

+ bleep bleep shoom

+ Seconds later, re-shoom, plain Vince

+ Wow this thing works!  What marvels are there here in the future?

  That guy paid a lot for those Os tickets I had.  I can
  use the money to get two tickets next time, not sure
  why he lauged when he said that, or what he meant about
  the Colts.

  [sign] retro computing.

  a _super_ nintendo?


  Wow a white apple II with a numeric keypad!  Those Apple II forever
  people were right.  And wow a flat panel screen!
  But where are the floppy drives?

  Look inside... whoa weird.  8 jigga-bytes?  How could anyone
  ever use that much>

  And whats this?  Raspberry pi?  700MHz? 512 MB of RAM?  I must
  have stumbled into some sort fof supercomputing center.  I better
  take this with me.
