\section{Red and Green Displays}

The red and green displays are separate from the yellow because
the 16-segment LEDs I could source had different pinouts, requiring
different PCB layout.

\subsection{Building the Red/Green LED Board}

Note, this assumes you want to socket everything (I typically do).
You can leave out all of the sockets if you're confident in your
abilities.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the 28-pin DIP socket and cut it into two pieces.
      The breakout board is too wide for a regular socket.
      Solder both halves on the back of the board.
      (I don't use SIP socket here as the breakout's pins are too
       wide to fit into it).
\item Cut the SIPs into the following pieces:
\begin{itemize}
\item 19 + 9 + 2
\item 19 + 4 + 4 + 2
\item 9 + 9 + 9 + 2
\item 9 + 9 + 9 + 2
\item 9 + 9
\end{itemize}
\item Solder the two 4-length SIP to the back of the board
      for the i2c sockets
\item Solder the 9-length SIPs to the front of the board for LED
      sockets.  This is easier if the LEDs are in the sockets to
      hold them parallel.
\item Take the two 19-length SIPs and trim off the middle pin
      (measure twice cut once).  Solder these in the year spot
\item Solder the 4 2-length SIPs where the colon and AM/PM LEDs go
\item Put the various displays in the proper sockets
\item Trim the LED legs and put in the LED spots
\item Aseemble the HT16K33 breakout and put in place in back
\end{enumerate}

You should be assembled!  Hook up to the i2c bus.  From above
the signals are ground, 5V, SDA, SCL.
