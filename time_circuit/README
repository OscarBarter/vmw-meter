Code and hardware for making time displays similar to that in the
BTTF movie.

Differences from movie:
+ The alphanum for the month in the movie are not physically
  realizable with 16-seg displays (see the 'D' in December)
+ The movie version uses a weird layout for the "6" without a top bar
+ Which LED (top or bottom) is AM/PM changed over the course of the movies
+ I prefer to use military time instead of PM anyway.
