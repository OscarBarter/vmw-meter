+ First you need to get the kernel headers installed so you can compile
	the module.  This is a pain on Raspbian as in general there isn't
	a nice package you can install.

   *	One way is to use rpi-source
	https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source

	Follow the directions to install and then

	rpi-source --skip-gcc

   * The above worked for me with the 4.1.7 kernel but not 4.1.13

	In that case instead I got headers from
	https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~mhiienka/Rpi/linux-headers-rpi/

	copy .config from /proc/config.gz, make oldconfig
	make scripts
	make prepare


+ Next run "make"

+ Then "insmod ./pi-ps2gpio.ko"
