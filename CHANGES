+ Add new clock demo
+ Release (0.2)

5 June 2010
+ Make i2c targets for actual hardware
+ After day of debugging got the actual hardware displaying
  two digits.  The major problem was i2c on Linux using
  the shifted by one addresses, while the chip docs use
  unshifted.
  
13 June 2010
+ More work on adding digits.  Having trouble
  getting the right values for the voltage divider resistors.
+ Release version (0.3)

16 June 2010
+ Add scroll_string demo
+ Release version (0.4)

1 August 2010
+ Write program to calculate better resistor values for votage divider.
+ Finally have full hardware prototype working.
+ Release version (0.5)

2 August 2010
+ Implemented a passable version of a cpumeter, as
  that's what in theory this is all about. Combines all
  three modes of the simple meter into one big program.
