Q.  Why are your printed circuit board designs so horrible?

A.  These were my first ever PCB designs.  If you have any
    suggestions, please send them in.
    
    
Q.  I'd like to build my own.  Can I buy the premade PCBs?

A.  If there's any interest I can place them for sale on
    sparkfun PCB.  The current boards have design issues
    that need to be worked around when being built, so
    I didn't want to release them for sale.
