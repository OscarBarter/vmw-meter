Some tests of using the Raspberry Pi GPIOs to drive a 74HC595.

This allows using a few pins to get 8 (or 16 bit) parallel output.
Also it does 3.3V to 5V level shifting.

For my code, I am using 3 GPIOS

	+ DS (serial data) connects to GPIO17
	+ SHCP or SRCLK (serial clock) connects to GPIO27
	+ STCP or RCLK (latch clock) connects to GPIO22
	+ |OE is tied to ground, so always is outputting
	+ |MR or |SRCLR (reset) is tied to +5V
