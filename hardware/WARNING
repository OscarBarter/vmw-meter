The PCBs included here have various errata.

Logic Board:
+ The board is slightly too wide, needing filing around a screw hole
  to fit in an A-31 case.
+ The sockets for the SAA1064 are too close together (no room for
  overhang) so the middle one needs to be lofted.
+ The vertical-oriented cable socket is too close to the bottom
  left horizontal one, so the cable connector needs to be clipped
  to fit.

LED Board:
+ The sockets for the cables are too close together, not allowing
  for overhang.  The middle one needs to be lofted
+ The markings for the RED LEDs are reversed, they need to be
  inserted backward.
