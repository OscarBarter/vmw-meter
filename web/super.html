<h3>Background</h3>

This is a project I've been occasionally working on since 1998.
I have had a <a href="index.html">simple 8-LED CPU meter</a> for years.  
Since my time as an undergrad I've been planning a fancier, 
alphanumeric replacement.  After a few abandoned attempts, I'll soon 
have a finished version.

<br><br>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

I eventually plan to post the plans.  It had six 14-segment
LTP3786E digits (red-orange), two 10-element bar graphs (green),
12 additional red LEDs, and 6 colorful LEDs (roygbv).
<br><br>
Current plans are to use 4 SAA1064 driver chips, driven by Linux
over an i2c bus (provided by a parallel port).
<br><br>


<h3>Software</h3>
Even if you don't have the parts to build a meter yourself, you can
download the software, which provides a text-mode emulation of the
hardware.  That way you can watch the demos or even program
new ones.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="vmw-meter-0.9.tar.gz">vmw-meter-0.9.tar.gz (135k) 14 
September 2010</a>
</ul>

Featured tools:
<ul>
<li>CPU Meter -- bar graphs show odd/even CPU usage, 
    text display of total CPU percentage, random and cylon/knight-rider
    usage speed on remaining LEDs
<li>Clock -- shows time, day of week, and 32-bit UNIX time (latter in
    binary).  Also occasionally shows day/month/year.
<li>Music Visualizer -- shows left/right VU bargraphs, as well
    as text of what song is playing
<li>Scrolling Text -- list arbitrary text files to the display
</ul>

<h3>Pictures</h3>

Here's the display portion of the PCB!  This is my first-ever
PCB design, so sorry if it looks rough:<br>

Here's some pictures of the finished prototype, running the "spin" 
demo:<br>

Here's an earlier picture of the hardware with only two digits 
implemented:<br>

Here's the emulator running the pulse demo that just toggles
the LEDs on and off:<br>

Here's the emulator running the spin demo, which has a 
recurring pattern spinning around the display:<br>
<img src="spin_demo.png"><br><br>

Here's the display showing text.  Currently it just prints static
strings, fancier display modes are planned:<br>

Here's the clock demo.  The border is showing time_t in 32-bit binary
(not Y2038 safe!) and the main display shows the time.  Occasionally
the day / date / year is shown as well.<br>
