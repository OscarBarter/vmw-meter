<h3>Previous <em>VMW</em> Meter Designs</h3>

This page is an archive of previous attempts to get 
an Alpha-numeric CPU meter going.  See my ongoing work
on the same project <a href="super.html">here</a>.

<br><br>

Back in 1998 I had hoped to find a readily-available LED driver
that could handle a 14-segment display, hopefully with multiplexing
and other nice features.  At the time I could not find spec sheets
for anything except 7-segment drivers.  Thus I decided to do things the
hard way.
<br><br>
The prototype used 7400 series logic (there were flip flop arrays
to store state, serial/parallel converters to take the info from
the PC over the parallel port, and a 555 timer to run the
multiplexer).
<br><br>

Here are some pictures (circa 2001).
It is displaying a "W" on the alphanumeric LED.  It is programmed via the 
parallel port into a 16-bit shift register.

Here some of the register-set RAM is hooked up. It is displaying an "M".

Here multiplexing is working and lighting up 2 
digits at once.  It's hard to see but it is saying "OK".

Sadly I ran out of time and the project languished for years.
I just now (in 2010) removed all of the parts from the above
pictured breadboards, and I'll be re-implementing things
using an LED driver chip (<a href="super.html">see here</a>).
